## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The current implementation of the project is based on HTML and Bootstrap CSS.This website is mobile and different device fully responsive. This is now a static website but by the time I will make this website dynamic by using react. There is a variety of functionalities which can be triggered by clicking on an icon or searching for a specific field in the original website. These all actions/functionalities can be done using react. By using React, code optimization,code reusability will be increased and website will be more handy.
